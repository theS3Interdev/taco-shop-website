# Taco Shop Website

This is a simple project created to learn the basics of HTML. The project is
bundled with Vite.js, which is a build tool that helps you develop and deploy
web applications quickly and easily.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you can follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using Git or download the zip file
   and extract it to your desired directory and run the following command to
   install the project dependencies.

```
yarn
```

2. Open the project directory and find the index.html file.

3. Double-click the index.html file to open it in your default web browser. You
   should see the basic HTML page that's included in the project.

4. To make changes to the HTML page, open the index.html file in a text editor
   and edit the code as desired. You can run the project in development mode
   using the following command:

```
yarn dev
```

5. To build the project for deployment, open the terminal and navigate to the
   project directory. Run the following command:

```
yarn build
```

This will create a dist folder that contains the optimized and minified files
that you can deploy to a hosting service.
